      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a life long learner I am always up for new challenges that push my limits of creativity and knowledge.  Much of my professional experience is in the insurance industry, but within the industry we are working with a broad range of technologies that can range from old programs to the newest applications.
          I am a self starter who takes pride in my work and loves to customize the products I build.<p>
